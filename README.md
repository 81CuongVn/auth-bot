- Allow Owner to remove membership option.
- Allow Owner to use either membership. (Renewal is the default choice)
- Plenty of commands that Owner can use.
- More to come...

## Instruction

- npm install
- npm run dev or npm run build or pm2 start (to run it forever in your local pc!)
- change config.example.json => config.json
- everything in the config.json must be filled in.
  - for mongoURI, you can leave as default or create an mlab account and get a cloud DB instead of using local (its free btw).
  - In addition, owner should set their roles, and to fetch memberRoleID.

## Stuff that doesn't work yet

- You can't renew because I haven't implemented stripe into this auth bot.
- You can't delete anyone key, I'll implement that soon
- Memberships doesn' work yet, but will have that implemented into bot very soon!

## Usage

- Type +help command, and it will prompt you with list of commands
- Give the discord bot, a staff role or anything that is better than a member role
- If user key expires, bot removes the role.
- There's only one package and that is renewal package - one key is good up to 30 days.
- You "OWNER" are able to delete anyone keys and boot them off the server
- OWNER can generate there own license key if they don't have.
  - you can even put your own key if you have, just make sure it's one per line!

## Q/A

- Can I put my own licenses that I creates in the bot?
  Yes, you can just copy & paste to keys.txt file and space 1 key per line
- How do I handle if key surpassed 30 days?
  You don't have to worry because the bot does everything for you.
- What type of membership option do I have?
  Currently stripe and paypal is not implemented.
- What happen if the user key expired?
  As of now, they will simply lose role, and will have to get a new license in order to gain access again.
- Is the auth bot protected?
  Yes, it is heavily protected, and a lot of error handling + security work. There shouldn't be any problem with the auth bot.
- I still have questions?
  Simply dm on twitter.

## Errors/Bugs

- If you encounter any errors/bugs, google the error/bug first, before asking me. If you can't figure it out then DM on twitter.
